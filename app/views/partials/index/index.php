                            The kindergarten system which is our project for the subject of system
analysis and design. We as a team worked together in groups and studied our given task. We
researched and gathered information that are relevant to our project as the part of literature
review.
Technology has been the massive changes over the years. We can look at any information or
issues that are ongoing in the current life. One important thing that needs to be done for every
company or business is their own website system. Here, my team choose a kindergarten
named Tadika Era Genius located at Johor Bahru for our project management system. We
had an interview with the principal of the kindergarten, Mrs. Yamuna a/p Gangatharan to
gather the information we needed for the project. We had clear answers to the questions we
proposed to them. As the interview went by, we got to know they do not have an official website
for the kindergarten other than social media which is Facebook.
We had a questionnaire regarding the system for the parents and teachers as well. On the
responses, we got to know many of the answers refer to photo updates of the kidâ€™s activity,
upcoming celebrations on, and more reviews or feedback from parents.
This system is mainly to reach more parents who have toddlers that need childcare education.
The purpose is to attract more people in looking at the website and register their kids in the
school by online application.
